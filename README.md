# Efficient Development
Rules to live by. Written using GitLab, git, and Jira terminology, but generalizable to any software development tools.

- Use [trunk based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) and avoid multiple persistent branches
- Integrate early and often (continuously)
- Give everyone (even people outside your team) developer access and don't attempt to control what they do
  - Just protect the main branch
- Always make the change in the most-upstream repository
- Prefer Merge Requests (MRs) over Jira tickets
  - MRs allow one click completion of the changeset if there's agreement
  - MRs allow visible discussion of the changeset alongside the code to reach agreement
  - MRs avoid the misinterpretation that often happens when playing telephone through email ➡ chat ➡ Jira ➡ git
  - Jira tickets are useful as a promise to do some work in the future that we don't have time to do now
    - Only if you actually promise to do that work
  - Clear and comprehensive MR descriptions are far more important than individual commit messages
    - Updating the MR description costs nothing, work on continuously improving it
- If a Jira ticket exists, reference it in MR description to automatically link and close upon completion
- Make your work visible
  - Open draft MRs extremely early (even just a README update saying what you're going to go do) to allow early review and course correction
  - Commit and push frequently
- Keep MRs small
- Keep branches short-lived and merge from main frequently
- Match existing code
  - Unless that code is broken or terrible, in which case update it everywhere, not just in your new code
- Drive MRs to closure before opening new ones
  - Unless you find a bug that can be spun off and completed via a smaller incremental MR sooner
- Resolve MR concerns efficiently
  - Developers are empowered to resolve threads about typos when they make the fix
  - Larger / open-ended / architectural concerns shall be resolved by the originator of the thread (only)
  - Reviewers should prefer the [suggest changes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/reviews/suggestions.html) feature whenever possible to allow quicker application by the developer
    - Or just push a commit that fixes that spelling mistake
      - But don't push big changes without talking to the developer
  - Once a reviewer approves, consider all threads they originated resolvable by anyone
  - Reviewers should consider explicitly stating "feel free to resolve" or "I'd like to review the changes" to avoid confusion
- Link liberally to other MRs and comment threads, those linkages will pay significant dividends later
- Add all stakeholders as reviewers to all MRs, even if they aren't on the team that owns that repository
- Automate everything that can be automated
  - Unless that automation is fragile and will cost more to maintain than doing it manually
- Establish coding standards early and automate enforcement
- Checklists are useful, only for things that can't be automated
- Don't build or rely on anything that you aren't willing or able to maintain
  - You aren't able to maintain plain text documentation of source code ... autogenerate it instead
  - You aren't able to maintain complex shell scripts
  - You aren't able to maintain anything that doesn't have tests
- Beware the normalization of pipeline failures: always keep the main branch healthy
- Leverage third party tools (CMake) and third party documentation, don't write custom wrappers (build.sh)
- Never duplicate code
  - Unless it's more complex or fragile to rely on one copy
- Never triplicate code
